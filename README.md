## Notes  

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. 

-Overall building the Tip Calculator was not very chanllenging for me. The video tutorial was great help for me, it really teached me the basics of how to build an app. The only thing that was a little difficult was submiting the app but I was able to acomplish the task.
